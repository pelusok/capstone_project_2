## Capstone Project 2: Donors Choose<br/>
#### The Problem: <br/>
DonorsChoose.org funds classroom requests through the support of over 3 million donors.  DonorsChoose.org is unique because it allows the donor to fund specific projects for specific schools, and specific teachers. Donors are able to browse projects, and fund ones that are important to them.  Requests come in the form of all kinds of items, from books, to furniture, to electronics. In order to continue supporting public school classrooms, DonorsChoose.org must work to ensure that first time donors continue to make ongoing donations. Donors typically first visit DonorsChoose.org to make a one time donation, and for the sustainability of DonorsChoose.org it is important to convert one time donors into recurring donors. <br/>
#### The Data: <br/>
The dataset was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/donorschoose/io. This dataset had been shared during a previously held contest. The data was initially broken up into 6 different .csv files (donations, donors, projects, teachers, resources and schools). In order to understand the data better, all data was initially examined separately before being joined into one dataframe<br/>
