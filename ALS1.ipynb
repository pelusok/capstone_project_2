Because of all these unique student our staff tries to create an inviting school for both students and parents.  We provide many interactive opportunities for our students, and our smaller class sizes and in-class work help support many of the struggles our students had at their previous schools. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->The goal of the frying pans and lids is to help students learn to create healthy meals.  The students will learn about nutrition and the benefits of good nutrition.  They will learn the basics of recipe reading as well as skill in adapting recipes to fit the ingredients that may be present in their home kitchens.  Then in class students will learn to prepare healthy meals that they can prepare for their families at home and their future families. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->Donating to this project will change the lives of the students in class.  These students will go from people that have to eat out or eat frozen meals to students that can prepare healthy meals for their future families.  It has been shown that families that eat stay together.  Our students are evidence that families need to sit down together and enjoy time together.  Give to the future of these students and their kids. </td><td>I remember sitting down to a family meal every evening when I was growing up. \n\nWhen I ask student how many of them sit down with their families and eat, very few do.

We are a suburban school on the edge of a large city, which consists of the working poor. In many families both parents work, and the priority is putting food on the table and taking care of the basics.

Our parents are active in the school and care about their children. 47% of our students are working at or above level. I am a special education teacher, with 7 students ranging in age from pre-K to second grade. I share a room with a teacher who has 8 students in 3rd-4th grade.

All are reading below level, and some are non-readers. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->The reading center is in constant use. I try to read at least two books aloud each day to students. As I have primary grades, I often read big books. Right now the books are all piled on a filing cabinet, which makes it difficult to find books and keep them clean. The students sit on our two taped-up bean bags chairs and the rug and listen. Other times they sit in the center and read independently, choosing books at their level from the bins. Sometimes one of the teachers sits in the center with the students, instructing and listening to them read, or reading aloud to them the book from their classroom. Students  become tired of sitting in desks and chairs for whole day, and sitting on the floor is a welcome relief. \n\nI would like to have a warm, inviting spot for them to relax in. Therefore, I am requesting two bean bag chairs, a cozy lounger, books on CD, a big book holder to organize their books and keep them clean, and two tangles for the students to hold while reading.

We want to coax our students away from video games and television and entice them into the world of reading. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->Our school is 90% low income, and 58% of our students don't speak English as their first language. We are a suburban school on the edge of a large city, which consists of the working poor. In many families both parents work, and the priority is putting food on the table and taking care of the basics. A lot of our families have someone out of work, as the recession has hit hard.\n\nPeople in our school district tend to stay, and many families are related. Our parents are active in the school and care about their children. 47% of our students are working at or above level. I am a special education teacher, with 7 students ranging in age from pre-K to second grade. I share a room with a teacher who has 8 students in 3rd-4th grade. My students range from those with a mild disability to those who have more challenges. Some are very active, with many having ADD. Others have learning disabilities or a developmental delay. All are reading below level, and some are non-readers. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->The reading center is in constant use. I try to read at least two books aloud each day to students. As I have primary grades, I often read big books. Right now the books are all piled on a filing cabinet, which makes it difficult to find books and keep them clean. The students sit on our two taped-up bean bags chairs and the rug and listen. Other times they sit in the center and read independently, choosing books at their level from the bins. Sometimes one of the teachers sits in the center with the students, instructing and listening to them read, or reading aloud to them the book from their classroom. Students  become tired of sitting in desks and chairs for whole day, and sitting on the floor is a welcome relief. \n\nI would like to have a warm, inviting spot for them to relax in. Therefore, I am requesting two bean bag chairs, a cozy lounger, books on CD, a big book holder to organize their books and keep them clean, and two tangles for the students to hold while reading. I feel a comfortable reading center will help them reduce their stress levels, which makes a more optimum learning environment. I want them to associate reading with enjoyment, encouraging them to love reading. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->Our classroom consists of mismatched cast offs from other rooms. Our students, all with disabilities, are reading below level. Reading is a challenge for them and often a difficult experience. By creating a warm, comfortable center, and reading aloud to them, we hope to instill in them a desire to read. By buying books on CD, they can listen. By allowing them to read on bean bags and soft chairs instead of plastic and metal chairs at their desks, we know they will associate reading with pleasure. </td><td>Every child can become a book lover.

Our schools population of students come from all over the world. \n\nOur school is a Title 1 public school, and my classroom alone serves around 100 students. Many of the students in my classroom are being served in one or more of the following programs: ESOL (English as a second language), Special Education, and TAG (our district's Gifted Program). \n\nOur students work incredibly hard each and every day at school! Every year, I am amazed by the progress the students are making, and the effort they are putting forth in school. I love my job, and I feel incredibly blessed to work with such amazing students! <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->By the end of the day, many of our students struggle to sit still and focus during math class. We have found success with allowing students to bounce up and down on yoga balls during class, but unfortunately these take up a ton of space in the classroom. \n\nHokki stools allow our students to wiggle/rock/dance/bounce in their seat while focusing on their math assignments!

All of my students are English Language Learners, meaning English is not their first language. Many of these students speak their native language at home, and cannot receive much support from their parents because of this language barrier. Many of my students qualify for free and reduced lunch which means their families face financial hardships at home. \nEven with the hardships these children face, they come to school happy and excited to learn each and every day! \nI strive to provide a safe, comfortable, and enriching environment for my students so that they can become successful, responsible citizens in the future!  <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->This iPad would be the first step in bringing more technology into our classroom. My students need exposure to more technology because that is the future. STEAM is just starting to grow at our school, but we lack the resources to equip all of our students with a device. More and more, schools are becoming saturated with technology. I would like to give my students the technology experience they need to be successful in middle school, high school, and beyond. It is an exceptional tool to have in my toolkit for ELL (English Language Learner) students who are learning English as a second language. There are countless Apps for my students to enhance their learning of the English language, not to mention - students love using iPads! They will learn while having fun, which is very motivating for children. \n\nStudies have shown that students who use iPads in school for learning scored higher on literacy tests than those who don't. \n\nMy students would benefit from more exposure to technology.

My students are the best thing that have happened to me, and I work very hard to make sure they get all the resources they need and deserve. I am trying to do all that I can to provide the resources my students need to enrich and progress their reading skills. This is a big challenge for me because I do not have the funding for materials, like books. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->With these books I am requesting,my emergent readers will benefit. My lower leveled readers will finally be able to read and comprehend the text they are reading, instead of pushing themselves to read information that is too hard and getting frustrated. Also, they will finally have more of a variety as my stronger readers so. Also, these books will help me model strategies for reading to my students. This will be done specifically in one of our upcoming reading units, which involves books in a series. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->By providing books for my students, they will continue to enjoy reading and push themselves to become better readers.

They also love being sung to. In music class, we read books by singing them!  By bringing authentic books and songs into the music room, we are giving children an enriching musical and literary experience that they look forward to every class. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->Our school is extremely diverse.  We speak many languages including English, Spanish, Urdu, Farsi, Vietnamese, and many others! Many of our families are underprivileged; some do not have appropriate clothing or food for their children.  Despite the fact that their homes are difficult places, our students are hardworking individuals who strive for success. Most students at our school receive free or reduced lunch and are eligible for assistance from community outreach programs. Students in the music room sing, dance, create, improvise, play instruments, and learn about other core subjects during music class.  Their smiles light up my life and make my job a privilege. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->With the materials requested, students will have a more enriching musical experience.  In every class, we share a songtale.  This can be any type of folk story that is set to song.  These stories are mostly fiction and encompass many cultures, subjects, geographical areas, and topics.  Some of our favorite titles are The Tailor and the Mouse, I Had a Little Rooster, and The Crabfish. Students love to hear these stories sung to them at the end of music class. Having these books in class would allow the children to see the beautiful illustrations and follow the words on the pages, thus improving reading and listening skills.\n\nThe other resources that were requested are materials we would use in every music class to vary the repertoire of activities.  Varying the types of songs we sing or movement games we play helps students to hear and feel different types of music.  These activities engage their minds and hearts in the music room and make them life long lovers of music. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->We have an impoverished population of students at our school which limits the resources and opportunities for growth at home.   Having these literary resources in our music room will help build  reading and listening skills.  Reading and listening are important  and fundamental life skills.
